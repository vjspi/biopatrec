% 2015-01-26 / Enzo Mastinu / A new GUI_Recordings has been developed for the
                            % BioPatRec_TRE release. Now it is possible to
                            % plot more then 8 channels at the same moment, for 
                            % time and frequency plots both. It is faster and
                            % perfectly compatible with the ramp recording 
                            % session. At the end of the recording session it 
                            % is possible to check all channels individually, 
                            % apply offline data process as feature extraction or filter etc.                           
% 2015-02-20 / Enzo Mastinu / Added the scaling of the data: now every channel plot will be 
                            % dynamically and automatically resize to fit in the proper portion
                            % of the main plot. This is to avoid overlapping of channels 
                            % waveforms and to have always the best zoom for every channel.
% 2015-02-23 / Enzo Mastinu / The scale of every channel plot is now the
                            % same scale of the channel which has the
                            % maximum absolute value
% 2015-02-24 / Enzo Mastinu / Now it is possible to choose if delete or not
                            % the offset introduced by the AFE from the time
                            % window plot
