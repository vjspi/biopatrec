% 2012-11-23 / Joel Falk-Dahlin  / Creation
% 2012-02-23 / James Austin  / Changed MovMatrix to use movement classes from
%                           pattern recognition controller (patRec.mov(1), patRec.mov(1), etc.) 
%                           instead of matching to pre-defined labels ('Open Hand', etc.),
%                           so that TrackStateSpace now works for any set of up to 6
%                           input movement classes (plus rest) chosen for the TAC test.
% 2018-11-26 / Adam Naber / Changed MovMatrix to rely directly on the number of indivicual
%                           movements themselves, rather than making any assumptions about
%                           the number of available movements.
